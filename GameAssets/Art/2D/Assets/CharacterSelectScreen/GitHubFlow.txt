This step has 3 looks:
-First, all the character cards over the starfield background with the "Choose Two Customers" text at the bottom.
-Second, the first character is selected by tapping their card.  The selected character's card disappears, and their selected box appears on the bottom left of the screen.
-In this second look, the "Who else?" text appears at the bottom right of the screen.
-Third, the second character is selected, in the same manner and their selected box appears at the bottom left of the screen.
-Simultaneously, the "Feed Them!" button appears above the selected boxes and the remaining character cards disappear.
-At any time, if the user taps a character's selected box, that selected box disappears and the character's card reappears.
-When the user taps the "Feed Them!" button, they go to the Wordmaking phase.
-Character selected boxes are not positioned in these files, but they are to scale.
